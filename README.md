# Gesture-Control-Light-System

This Python project uses hand gestures to control a virtual light (ON/OFF), adjust screen brightness, and modify image color in real-time.

Features:

1. Light Control: Turn the light ON or OFF based on the number of fingers raised on the left hand.
2. Brightness Adjustment: Adjust the image brightness dynamically using the number of fingers raised on the left hand.
3. Color Control: Change the color based on the number of fingers raised on the right hand.
